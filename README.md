# red-light-green-light
Red Light/Green light game for a challenge created with Angular 13 and Ionic 6


# How to make it run (locally)
- 1. You need to have installed [Nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs) and [Ionic Cli](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started/).
- 2. Install packages: "npm i"
- 3. Run the server: "ionic serve"
- 4. After that, your browser will open a tab with the app. Otherwise go [here](http://localhost:8100/)

# How to play 
The game is based on make steps as you are doing normally in real life. That means, you should step one leg and then the other (left and right). 
If you make this movement when the image is green, then you will be able to score a point. If you try to go just with one leg (for example the left one), a point will be discounted from your score until you reach 0. 

If you are playing without a keyboard (usually is from a mobile), your only way to make steps will be clicking the buttons on the screen.
If you are playing with a keyboard, you will be able to make steps clicking the buttons on the screen or clicking the arrows (left and right) in your keyboard.

Attention! If you do any movement (clicking the screen or any button) when the icon is red, you will lose the game.
